# Cut AWS Costs with CloudFix RightSpend — No Long-Term Commitment

Traditional savings mechanisms like Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans (SPs) often require long-term commitments and significant upfront investments, which can limit flexibility and result in wasted resources. Enter CloudFix RightSpend — a revolutionary solution designed to maximize your AWS Effective Savings Rate (ESR) without tying you down to rigid commitments. In this article, we’ll explore how RightSpend leverages intelligent automation to optimize your AWS EC2 compute costs, delivering savings equivalent to 3-year all-upfront Compute Savings Plans — without the 3-year lock-in or hefty upfront cash outlay.

# The Importance of Effective Savings Rate (ESR)

The Effective Savings Rate (ESR) is a critical metric for understanding your AWS cost efficiency. It measures the percentage discount achieved on compute usage — covering services like EC2, Fargate, and Lambda — by utilizing discount instruments such as RIs and SPs, and Spot Instances compared to On-Demand pricing. A higher ESR reflects smarter use of these tools, directly translating to lower compute costs and greater budget flexibility.

However, achieving a high ESR traditionally involves trade-offs. Savings Plans and RIs often demand 1- or 3-year commitments, locking you into specific instance types or spend levels that may not adapt to fluctuating workloads. Spot Instances, while cost-effective, require fault-tolerant architectures that not all applications support. This is where CloudFix RightSpend steps in, offering a game-changing approach to cost optimization that balances savings with agility.

# Introducing CloudFix RightSpend: Savings Without the Strings

CloudFix RightSpend is an innovative software solution that redefines AWS cost optimization by focusing on Convertible Reserved Instances (cRIs) — flexible savings instruments that can be exchanged for different instance types and configurations. Unlike traditional approaches, RightSpend dynamically and continuously optimizes cRIs nearing expiration, achieving discounts equivalent to 3-year all-upfront Compute Savings Plans without requiring a long-term commitment or significant upfront payment.

## How RightSpend Works

RightSpend operates with precision and adaptability, adjusting your cRI commitments hourly based on real-time data about your running EC2 instances, active Savings Plans, and standard RIs. Here’s how it delivers value:

- Increasing Coverage Without Commitment: RightSpend scales up cRI commitments by exchanging smaller instances (e.g., a t4g.nano) for larger ones (e.g., an m5.8xlarge). Expiration dates remain unchanged, or AWS selects the longest date when merging multiple cRIs, preserving flexibility.
- Reducing Commitment When Needed: RightSpend can decrease hourly cRI commitments by merging instances with different expiration dates (e.g., turning three m5.large cRIs expiring in 10 and 20 months into two expiring in 20 months), all while maintaining or increasing total spend commitment — perfectly compliant with AWS APIs and described in detail in AWS documentation: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-convertible-exchange.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-convertible-exchange.html)
- Complementary Coverage: RightSpend works seamlessly alongside existing Savings Plans and standard RIs, continuously monitoring your AWS accounts and adjusting cRIs to complement existing SP/sRI coverage.

## Two Ways You Save (Plus a Bonus)

Customers using RightSpend experience material net-new savings in two key areas:

1. Improved ESR: As existing Savings Plan commitments expire, RightSpend steps in to replace them with optimized cRIs, boosting your discount rate without locking you into new long-term plans.
2. Coverage for Dynamic Workloads: RightSpend targets variable EC2 usage that often defaults to expensive On-Demand pricing, applying cRI discounts to reduce costs without requiring architectural changes.

Bonus: Less Planning, Less Hassle — No more long-term compute forecasts or complex risk analysis. Since commitments adjust automatically, forecasting becomes unnecessary.
