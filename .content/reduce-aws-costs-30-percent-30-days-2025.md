### Opening Hook (200 words)
Start with compelling promise: "Last month, a SaaS company with a $45,000 monthly AWS bill cut it to $31,500 in 28 days - without touching a single line of code or impacting performance. Another enterprise reduced their $180,000 quarterly cloud spend by $54,000 using the same systematic approach youre about to learn."

Set expectations: This isn't about risky shortcuts or service downgrades. These are battle-tested strategies that maintain performance while delivering immediate savings.
