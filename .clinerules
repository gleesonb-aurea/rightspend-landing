Key Insights:

Tool Usage Patterns:
- The replace_in_file tool is useful for making targeted edits to existing files.
- The write_to_file tool is useful for creating new files or overwriting existing files.

Project-Specific Patterns:

- The deployment process relies on GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment steps.
- The `fix-paths.js` script is used to adjust file paths after the build process. This script should be carefully reviewed and updated to ensure that all paths are correctly transformed.

New Insights:
- It's important to verify that external resources (e.g., CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts) are loaded correctly and that the paths to these resources are correct.
- The order in which scripts are executed can affect the behavior of the website. It's important to ensure that scripts are executed in the correct order.
- Shared components (header/footer) can be used to enforce a consistent look and feel across the website.
- Shared components can be used to include common resources (e.g., Google Analytics, Apollo, RevenueBase) across the website, but these resources are loaded in `src/scripts/main.js`.
- Wrapping the code in `src/scripts/main.js` in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener ensures that the script runs after the DOM is fully loaded.
