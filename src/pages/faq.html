                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                            RightSpend typically delivers 20-55% savings on AWS EC2 costs compared to on-demand pricing. The exact savings depend on your current coverage mix of Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and on-demand usage patterns.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            Most customers see immediate savings within 30 days of implementation, with average savings of 35-40% for mixed workloads and up to 55% for stable, predictable usage patterns.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                            CFDs eliminate the risk of over-committing to AWS resources. While Savings Plans require 1-3 year commitments that can become costly if your usage decreases, CFDs provide similar discount rates with zero commitment penalty.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">

                            Yes! RightSpend is designed to complement your existing AWS discount strategy. It works seamlessly with Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Enterprise Discount Programs (EDP) to optimize uncovered or inefficiently covered EC2 usage.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                            Convertible Reserved Instances (cRIs) allow you to change instance families, operating systems, and tenancy during the term. RightSpend leverages cRIs' flexibility to provide commitment-free savings by continuously optimizing these conversions based on your actual usage patterns.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            Cross-region optimization ensures you get the best rates regardless of where your workloads run, with automatic regional rebalancing as your usage patterns change.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                            RightSpend uses read-only AWS permissions with minimal IAM privileges, SOC2 Type II compliance, end-to-end encryption, and never stores sensitive customer data outside of AWS.

                            No modifications are required. RightSpend works at the AWS billing and reservation layer, not at the application level. Your EC2 instances, applications, and operational procedures remain completely unchanged.

                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                            No. RightSpend provides Commitment Free Discounts (CFDs) with complete flexibility. Unlike traditional Savings Plans or Reserved Instances, you can scale resources up or down without penalties or break-even concerns.

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800">How does RightSpend pricing work?</h3>
                        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                            RightSpend uses a performance-based fee structure - you only pay a percentage of the savings we generate. There are no upfront costs, setup fees, or minimum commitments.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            This aligns our success with yours and ensures positive ROI from day one. If we don't save you money, you don't pay us.

                            Billing is transparent and based on verified savings shown in your AWS Cost and Usage Reports. You receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly how savings were generated, which resources were optimized, and ROI calculations.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            Advanced reporting includes cost center allocation, trend analysis, and executive summaries suitable for board-level presentations.
